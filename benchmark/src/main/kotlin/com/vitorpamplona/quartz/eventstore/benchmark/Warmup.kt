/**
 * Warm the client JVM and — for real Vespa — the engine's jdisc JIT before a
 * TIMED ingest, so reported rates are steady state, not JVM/JIT warmup.
 *
 * A freshly-deployed Vespa spends ~30s of its FIRST feed JIT-compiling the
 * Jetty/jdisc/docproc/messagebus pipeline to C2 (profiled: cumulative compile
 * time +33s in feed round 1, then ~0 by round 3), so a cold ingest reads ~1.5x
 * slower than warm (≈1,000 vs ≈1,500–1,800 EPS on the dev box). The query suites
 * already warm per shape (`repeat(warm){op}`); this covers the ingest side those
 * loops don't. Disable with `BENCH_WARMUP=0`.
 *
 * Feeds [n] id-disjoint throwaway events (band 0x9, so never colliding with a
 * seed-42/default-band corpus), then — when [cleanup] — deletes them so the
 * measured corpus stays clean for a store that will also be queried. Pass
 * `cleanup=false` for a throwaway store that is closed right after.
