/**
 * Mixed read/write load (`BENCH_MIXED=1`): a relay never serves queries from a
 * quiet store — REQs arrive WHILE syncs feed it. The query-only suite misses
 * that interference entirely (and the earlier throughput runs hinted it is
 * real: bulk-read throughput measured right after an ingest dropped ~30% while
 * proton flushed). This drives both sides of the store at once and reports how
 * much each loses to the other:
 *
 *  1. read-only baseline   — R readers, no writers
 *  2. write-only baseline  — W writers, no readers
 *  3. mixed                — both simultaneously
 *
 * Writers stream `batchInsert` chunks of fresh id-band-disjoint events (the
 * multi-relay sync shape — plan/guard reads overlap outside the store's writer
 * lock, commits serialize behind it, exactly as in production). Readers loop
 * the follow-feed (300 authors) and author-timeline shapes. Everything runs
 * through the real store stack against a live Vespa.
 *
 * Tunables: BENCH_MIXED_WRITERS (2), BENCH_MIXED_READERS (16),
 * BENCH_MIXED_MS (8000 per mode), BENCH_MIXED_BATCH (500).
