/**
 * An [EventIndex] decorator that counts every call the store makes to the engine.
 *
 * Against a real Vespa each of these is a network round-trip; against SQLite each
 * is a prepared-statement execution. Either way the COUNT is engine-independent —
 * it is a property of [NostrEventStore]'s own logic — so it is the cleanest way
 * to see the store layer's I/O amplification (the code comments claim "3-5 index
 * round-trips per event"; this measures the real figure per corpus) and to prove
 * the bulk path collapses that fan-out. That makes it the right lens for
 * optimizing THIS framework, independent of which engine sits underneath.
