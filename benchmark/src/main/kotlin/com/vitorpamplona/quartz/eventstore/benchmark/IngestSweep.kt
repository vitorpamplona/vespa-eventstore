/**
 * Bulk-ingest sweep (`BENCH_INGEST_SWEEP=1`): chunk size x parallel streams,
 * against a live Vespa, through the real store stack. Ingest on a single node
 * is throttle-floor-bound, not engine-bound — the feed client's dynamic
 * throttler idles at its `minInflight` floor under bursty batched writes — so
 * the open question is which knob actually raises throughput: bigger chunks
 * (fewer guard-read waves, longer put bursts), more concurrent `batchInsert`
 * streams (the multi-relay sync shape — plan/guard reads overlap outside the
 * store's writer lock), or both. This measures the grid and reports events/sec
 * plus per-CHUNK commit-latency tails.
 *
 * Every cell feeds genuinely fresh events (its own id band), so cell N+1 runs
 * against a slightly larger corpus than cell N — ingest cost grows only weakly
 * with corpus size, but read the grid as a comparison, not as absolutes.
 *
 * Tunables: BENCH_SWEEP_CHUNKS ("250,500,1000,2000"), BENCH_SWEEP_STREAMS
 * ("1,2,4"), BENCH_SWEEP_EVENTS (events per cell, default 4000).
