/**
 * Per-operation latency samples -> tail percentiles. Averages hide exactly
 * what a relay's SLO is made of — a p99 that moves independently of the mean
 * (GC pauses, proton flushes, the 5xx retry path all live in the tail) — so
 * every suite records individual operation times through one of these and
 * prints `p50/p95/p99` next to its throughput number.
 *
 * Thread-safe for the concurrent suites; recording is a synchronized list
 * append (sub-µs), far below the cost of the operations being measured.
