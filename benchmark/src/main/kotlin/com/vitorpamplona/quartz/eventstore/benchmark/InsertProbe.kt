/**
 * The focused per-event insert probe (`BENCH_INSERT_PROBE=1`): fresh inserts of
 * an id-band-disjoint mini corpus onto whatever the live Vespa already holds,
 * then a re-insert of the same events (all duplicates — the relay rebroadcast
 * case). Prints events/sec + µs/event for both. Everything runs through the
 * real store stack (feed client, admission guards, conditional put), so the
 * numbers are the store's, not a synthetic client's.
