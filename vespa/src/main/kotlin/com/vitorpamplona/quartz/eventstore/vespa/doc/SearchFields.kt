/**
 * The derived, kind-specific search surface of one event: what the store's
 * extractors decompose a searchable event into. All-null means the event is
 * invisible to NIP-50 search.
 *
 * There are two groups, LARGELY disjoint per kind, which is what lets the
 * schema's rank profiles compose them as a plain sum (see event.sd):
 *
 *  - the kind-0 profile group ([name]..[website]), with each field's role:
 *    name/displayName primary, nip05/lud16 identity (IDF), about/website
 *    affiliation;
 *  - the generic tiers for every other kind: [primary] (title/subject-like),
 *    [secondary] (summary/hashtag-like), [text] (the body), plus [location]
 *    (place names, filled systemically from any kind's `location` tags).
 *
 * The disjointness is not strict: a kind may also fill a profile ROLE column
 * when it carries that data — an app handler (kind 31990) fills the whole
 * profile group, and a repo/podcast/stream fills [website] for the
 * affiliation-domain treatment. The schema composes the groups with max()/sum,
 * so the overlap stays well-defined.
