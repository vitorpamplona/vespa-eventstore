/**
 * Builds a Vespa *document selection* from an [EventQuery]. A selection is the
 * expression language the document-API visit scans with: a streaming read over
 * the whole corpus, no result cap, no ranking. Only attribute-shaped
 * constraints translate: kinds, authors, owners, since/until, and the
 * not-yet-expired guard (`expires_at` is always materialized, so a plain range
 * works).
 *
 * Returns null when [q] carries anything a selection can't (or shouldn't)
 * express: ids, tags, a search term, a limit, the expiry-sweep bound, or a
 * non-64-hex key. In that case the caller falls back to the ranked `/search/`
 * path, which handles all of those. Keys are validated to 64-hex BEFORE they
 * are quoted into the expression (same injection rule as [EventYql]).
