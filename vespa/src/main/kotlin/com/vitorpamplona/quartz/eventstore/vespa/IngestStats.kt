/**
 * Process-wide wall-time accounting for the ingest pipeline's named stages. It
 * answers the question "the writer is busy 100%, but WHERE?". Stages
 * self-register on first use. [gauge] renders per-stage seconds since its last
 * call (a delta, not a running total) for a status-line breakdown like
 *
 *   stages dedup 1.2s guards 8.4s versions 22.1s write 9.0s proj.fetch 18.3s proj.write 4.1s
 *
 * It is global on purpose. The store and the projection are separate modules
 * composed per process, and threading a stats object through both APIs would
 * couple them for what is strictly observability.
