/**
 * Per-word fuzzy recall, extended with sot's generic tier fields. This is the
 * drift-prone half of [EventYql]. It must stay in lockstep with the schema's
 * search fields and match ladder, so it is isolated here from the generic
 * NIP-01/NIP-50 filter-to-YQL assembly. MockVespaEngine's parser guards against
 * drift.
 *
 * There is one OR group per query word: a word that matches ANY field recalls
 * the doc, and ranking sorts the results out. Two extra groups help multi-word
 * queries: a joined-CamelCase variant for 2+ words ("John Carvalho" finds
 * @johncarvalho), and adjacent-pair concatenations for 3+ words.
 *
 * Words go out-of-band as @w0..@w5 / @wj / @wp0.. query parameters, never
 * inlined, so no escaping is needed. The trigram literals are filtered to
 * alphanumeric characters, which makes them safe to embed.
