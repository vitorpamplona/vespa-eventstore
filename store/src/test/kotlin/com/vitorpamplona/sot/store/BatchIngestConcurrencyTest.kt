/**
 * The ingest-throughput probe. `InMemoryEventIndex` answers every round trip
 * instantly, so it hides the ONE thing that caps real ingest: whether the
 * per-batch engine round trips (dedup / guard / version reads, then the write)
 * happen UNDER the single writer lock (serialized across relays) or beside it.
 *
 * [LatencyEventIndex] gives each round trip a fixed virtual-time cost, and
 * `runTest`'s virtual clock turns "did these overlap?" into an exact number:
 * `currentTime` after N concurrent batches is the SUM of their costs if they
 * serialized, and closer to the MAX if their reads overlapped. No wall-clock,
 * no flakiness — the scheduler advances time only when everything is parked.
 *
 * This is the executable target for moving the read checks out of the write
 * lock: the concurrency assertion below fails while reads are serialized and
 * passes once they run beside each other.
