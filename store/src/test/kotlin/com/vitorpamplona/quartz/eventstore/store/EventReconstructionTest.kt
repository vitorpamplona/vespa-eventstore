/**
 * The [toEvent] fast path must be INDISTINGUISHABLE from the canonical
 * `Event.fromJson(toEventJson())` it replaces on the query hot path: for every
 * kind the factory-built event has the SAME runtime subclass AND serializes to
 * the SAME JSON as fromJson would. If a Quartz upgrade ever changed the by-kind
 * dispatch, this fails loudly rather than letting the store hand back a
