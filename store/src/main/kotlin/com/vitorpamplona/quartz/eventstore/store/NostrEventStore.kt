/**
 * Quartz [IEventStore] backed by the search engine itself: ONE copy of the
 * data, queryable with full NIP-01 filters plus NIP-50 search, and wrappable in
 * `ObservableEventStore` like any other store.
 *
 * It enforces Nostr semantics in [insertLocked]:
 *
 *  - duplicates rejected ("duplicate:");
 *  - replaceables/addressables: strictly-older versions (created_at, then
 *    LOWEST id wins ties) are deleted on insert, and an insert that lost that
 *    comparison is rejected ("replaced:");
 *  - kind 5: targets erased (e-tags by id, a-tags — including replaceable
 *    addresses — up to the deletion's created_at, same-owner only per NIP-09),
 *    the kind 5 kept as a tombstone, and covered inserts rejected ("blocked:");
 *  - kind 62 covering [relay]: the owner's strictly-older events erased, the
 *    request kept, covered inserts rejected ("blocked:");
 *  - deletion/vanish enforcement keys on the event's OWNER: the gift-wrap
 *    recipient for kind 1059, else the author. Recipients control the wraps
 *    addressed to them;
 *  - ephemeral kinds are accepted WITHOUT storing (persistence is a no-op per
 *    NIP-01; an observable wrapper still broadcasts them live); already-expired
 *    events rejected; [deleteExpiredEvents] sweeps due NIP-40 expirations via
 *    the derived `expires_at` attribute;
 *  - NIP-50: only kinds implementing [SearchableEvent] are searchable, via
 *    [SearchExtractors], which decomposes each kind's indexable content into the
 *    schema's per-kind search fields. [reindexFullTextSearch] re-derives them
 *    after extractor/Quartz upgrades.
 *
 * Correctness rests on two properties. First, all writes serialize behind one
 * [Mutex], so query-then-write is atomic against other writers in this process.
 * Second, [EventIndex] guarantees an acked put is visible to search (see its
 * contract). There are no cross-document transactions: [transaction] buffers and
 * applies sequentially without rollback, which relay semantics never needed.
 *
 * Events are NOT verified here. Verification is the ingest path's job
 * (syncer/relay), once, before insert.
