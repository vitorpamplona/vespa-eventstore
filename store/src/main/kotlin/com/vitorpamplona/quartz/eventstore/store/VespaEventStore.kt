 * The library's public handle AND front door: a ready [IEventStore] backed by

 * VespaReputationIndex)) stack over a running Vespa in one call (plus, by default,
 * a first-run schema deploy), and this handle delegates the entire [IEventStore]
 * surface to it — so a consumer programs against the Quartz interface and never
 * sees the stack.
 *
 * Vespa itself is a prerequisite, like a database: point [open] at one that is
 * already running.
 *
 * Closeable (via [IEventStore]'s AutoCloseable), so `open(...).use { ... }` works.
