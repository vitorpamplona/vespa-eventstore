/**
 * Maintains the `reputation` parent documents — the per-pubkey trust tensors the
 * schema imports into every event's ranking. It works as an [EventIndex]
 * DECORATOR: it wraps the index the store writes through, so every mutation that
 * touches trust data triggers a recompute.
 *
 * Observing the index (not the events) is the whole trick. The store's semantic
 * machinery — supersession, kind-5, vanish, sweeps, admin deletes — all funnels
 * into [put]/[remove] calls here, so every deletion style updates the tensors
 * with ZERO deletion-specific code.
 *
 * Recompute, never cell surgery: a change re-derives the SUBJECT's whole
 * [ReputationDoc] from the stored kind-30382s about them —
 *
 *   subject's 30382s (d = subject) -> signer is a SERVICE key
 *   -> observer = the kind-10040 author whose `30382:rank` entry lists that
 *      service key (NIP-85: cells are keyed by the OBSERVER, never the signer)
 *   -> influence_scores{observer} = rank tag, follower_counts{observer} =
 *      followers tag; a version without a rank tag contributes nothing
 *      (the provider retracted the score).
 *
 * Idempotent and self-healing; when no cells are left the parent doc is removed.
 * A 10040 change (new provider, switched provider, vanished observer) recomputes
 * every subject its service keys had scored. So late-arriving or superseded
 * provider lists re-attribute stored scores automatically.
 *
 * Recomputes run inline with the store's single-writer insert, so ranking is
 * read-your-writes consistent with the event corpus. [rebuildAll] re-derives
 * everything (bootstrap after enabling the projection on an existing index).
