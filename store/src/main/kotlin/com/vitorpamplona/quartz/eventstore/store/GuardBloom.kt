/**
 * A fixed-capacity, concurrent Bloom filter over owner keys — the scalable
 * backing for [GuardOwners], replacing an exact `HashSet` that had to give up
 * (and disable the guard-skip) past 10k distinct deleters.
 *
 * The ONLY property [GuardOwners] relies on for correctness is **no false
 * negatives**: [mightContain] returns `false` only for a key that was provably
 * never [add]ed, so skipping the guard probe on a `false` can never skip a
 * needed one. A Bloom filter guarantees exactly that — `false` means at least
 * one of the key's bits is unset, which is impossible after [add]. A false
 * POSITIVE (all bits collide) only costs a wasted probe — the same over-flag
 * cost the exact set's design already accepted — so a higher fill just trades
 * memory for probe count, NEVER for correctness.
 *
 * Thread-safe by construction: bits live in an [AtomicLongArray]; [add] ORs each
 * word atomically and [mightContain] reads words plainly (AtomicLongArray reads
 * carry volatile visibility). Concurrent add-of-X / test-of-Y is safe — Y's bits
 * that X does not touch are unaffected, and per the store's one-write-lane-per-
 * owner model no other lane tests X while X's own guard is being recorded.
 *
 * Sizing follows the standard Bloom optima for [expectedInsertions] at [fpp]:
 *   m = -n ln p / (ln 2)^2 bits,  k = round(m/n · ln 2) hashes.
 * Overfilling past [expectedInsertions] degrades gracefully — the false-positive
 * rate climbs (more wasted probes) but never yields a false negative.
