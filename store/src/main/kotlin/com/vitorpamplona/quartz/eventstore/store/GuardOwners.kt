/**
 * The set of owners with ANY stored tombstone or vanish — the key that lets the
 * admission path SKIP its NIP-09/NIP-62 guard probes for everyone else, which
 * is nearly everyone (content authors seldom publish deletions). Both guard
 * probes query kind-5/62 docs whose AUTHOR is the inserted event's owner, so
 * "no stored guard doc by this author" proves both probes would come back
 * empty.
 *
 * Why this is safe:
 *  - OVER-flagging (an owner in the set with no live guard) only costs a probe.
 *  - UNDER-flagging cannot happen within the store's write model: the set is
 *    preloaded from the engine (two grouping queries over kind 5 and kind 62)
 *    and every guard this store subsequently stores is added via
 *    [noteGuardStored]. A single writer — or one owner-sharded lane, since
 *    lanes never insert another lane's owners (docs/multi-node-consistency.md)
 *    — therefore always sees its owners' guards. A FOREIGN feeder writing
 *    kind 5/62 directly to the engine would bypass this (and every other
 *    query-then-write guarantee); that deployment shape needs the probes, so
 *    it should disable the cache.
 *  - Scale: the flagged owners live in a [GuardBloom], not an exact set, so a
 *    relay with millions of distinct deleters costs a few MB and the guard-skip
 *    KEEPS WORKING. The Bloom's no-false-negative property is exactly the
 *    UNDER-flag prohibition above; a false positive is just the harmless
 *    over-flag (a wasted probe). The load must be EXHAUSTIVE — [EventIndex.scanAuthors]
 *    is the uncapped visit, not the grouping [distinctAuthors] that truncates.
 *  - A FOREIGN feeder writing kind 5/62 directly to the engine still bypasses
 *    [noteGuardStored]; that deployment must set `GUARD_OWNERS_DISABLE=1` so
 *    every insert probes.
