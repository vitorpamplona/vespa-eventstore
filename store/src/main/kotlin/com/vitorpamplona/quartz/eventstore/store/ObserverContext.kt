/**
 * Carries the ranking observer from the relay session down to

 * (or the operator's default) whose web of trust weighs NIP-50 search hits.
 *
 * It is a coroutine-context element because the seam it crosses, Quartz's
 * `IEventStore`, has no per-caller parameter. The relay backend wraps each
 * REQ/COUNT in `withContext(ObserverContext(pubkey))`, and the store reads it
 * back to stamp `EventQuery.observer`. This is ranking context only; it never
 * changes which events match.

/**
 * Carries the ORIGINAL request filters past Quartz's extension stripping.
 *
 * Quartz's `LiveEventStore` runs `strippingSearchExtensions` on every REQ's
 * filters before they reach the store. That is the right default for stores
 * that would otherwise match `key:value` tokens as text, but this store HONORS
 * the NIP-50 `sort:`/`filter:rank:`/`include:spam` extensions and must see them.
 * The relay backend stashes the pre-strip filters here. The store then restores
 * each filter's `search` string by position — it is the same list in the same
 * order, only the search field differs — before mapping to [EventQuery].
