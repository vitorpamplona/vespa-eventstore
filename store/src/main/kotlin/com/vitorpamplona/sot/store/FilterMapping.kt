 * from.
 */

/**
 * Maps a Quartz Filter to the engine's plain [EventQuery]. Returns null when the
 * filter can never match. Under NIP-01, a present-but-EMPTY list means "the
 * event's value must be in the list" — of nothing, so it matches nothing. An
 * absent (null) list means no constraint, which is EventQuery's empty default.
 *
 * NIP-50 extensions are relay hints, not text. Quartz's parser splits them off,
 * and unlike a naive key:value regex it keeps `scheme://…` tokens as terms. The
 * extensions this store honors:
 *
 *  - `sort:rank[:desc]` / `sort:rank:asc` / `sort:followers` / `sort:text`
 *    pick the rank profile. With no terms this is a trust-ordered match-all.
 *  - `filter:rank:gte:N` / `filter:rank:gt:N` set the observer trust floor
 *    (rank_filtered when no sort chose a profile — text order, gated).
 *  - `include:spam` turns OFF the default trust floor. Every ranked query is
 *    otherwise gated at [DEFAULT_MIN_RANK], and include:spam is its inverse.
 *    Plain filter REQs (no terms, no sort) are never gated: that recall belongs
 *    to NIP-01, not to search.
 *  - `observer:<64-hex>` names the pubkey whose web-of-trust ranks the hits.
 *    It is the query-side way to pick the ranking lens (the relay otherwise
 *    supplies it from the NIP-42 connection); a non-hex value is ignored. With
 *    no observer resolved, a search degrades to pure-text relevance.
 *
 * Unknown extensions are ignored. A query that is nothing but extensions becomes
 * unconstrained (null terms), not match-nothing.
